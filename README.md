# ML Projects

Welcome to **ML-Projects** – a curated collection of machine learning projects and experiments. This repository contains projects that cover a variety of machine learning techniques, data analysis and predictive modeling, designed to provide hands-on experience with real-world datasets.

## 📝 About

This repository is intended as a central hub for all my machine learning projects. Each project is organized in its own folder, containing the necessary code, datasets and documentation to explore, understand and replicate the work.  

**The goal of this repository is to:**

- Demonstrate practical applications of machine learning concepts.
- Provide clean and well-structured code for learning and experimentation.
- Showcase data preprocessing, visualization, model building and evaluation techniques.
- Serve as a reference for anyone looking to explore machine learning projects.

## 📂 Structure

Each project resides in its own folder. The general structure is as follows:

```
Project_Name/
├── data/        # Datasets used in the project
├── notebooks/   # Jupyter notebooks (if any)
├── scripts/     # Python scripts or source code
└── README.md    # Project-specific information
```

> Note: Each project folder contains its own README with detailed explanations, instructions and outputs.

## 🛠 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zihanmanbit/ML-Projects.git
cd ML-Projects
```

2. Navigate to the project of interest and follow the instructions in its folder.

3. Most projects require Python 3 and standard ML libraries such as numpy, pandas, scikit-learn and matplotlib.
